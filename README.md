## 2. Rationale of Visualisation Tool – Tableau
- I have chosen Tableau as my visualisation tool. When I first researched some resources about Tableau, the ease of implementation and simple ways to create interactive visualisation looked very attractive.
- Furthermore, while it is easy to learn and carry out visualisation, Tableau also has various types of visualisations, including various plots, charts, maps and bubbles.
-  Offering desktop dashboard also seemed very convenient and flexible for users.

## 3. Data Processing and Cleaning
### Data Loading

- I used Tableau desktop dashboard and Imported dataset by selecting “text file” and brought it into the dashboard.

-  I found that Tableau Prep Builder has more available options for cleaning data than Tableau Desktop. Hence, I switched to Tableau Prep Builder for cleaning phase. The cleaning phase in Tableau Prep Builder was very simple and straightforward.
-  Another benefit of using Tableau Prep Builder was that it provided recommendations for cleaning data.

- After cleaning the data, I switched back to Tableau Desktop dashboard for visualization phase. I exported cleaned dataset as a csv file in Tableau Prep Builder and then imported it in Tableau Desktop.
- I have chosen a bar graph, a line graph and a visual world map to display visualizations of average of world university rankings and average scores from 2012 to 2015. The graphs clearly show that there is a correlation between university ranking and university score.
- The visual world map and bar graph also clearly display that there are mostly top universities in USA and Europe countries.

## 5. Personal User Experience
### Opportunity 
- There are tutorials for beginners on Tableau Desktop
- Comparatively easier to learn than other visualisation tools (Personal opinion)
- Ease of implementation and the process is very simple and straightforward.
- There are various types of visualisations available.
- There are recommendation tools for data cleaning and visualisations.
- Especially useful when analysing a large dataset.

### Challenges
- A lack of data cleaning options in Tableau Desktop
- Need to use two different tools, Tableau Prep Builder for data cleaning and visualisations for Tableau Desktop
- I found Tableau a bit difficult to create desired format and design of visualisations.
