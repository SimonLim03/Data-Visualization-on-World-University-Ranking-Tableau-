## 2. Rationale of Visualisation Tool – Tableau
- I have chosen Tableau as my visualisation tool. When I first researched some resources about Tableau, the ease of implementation and simple ways to create interactive visualisation looked very attractive.
- Furthermore, while it is easy to learn and carry out visualisation, Tableau also has various types of visualisations, including various plots, charts, maps and bubbles.
-  Offering desktop dashboard also seemed very convenient and flexible for users.

## 3. Data Processing and Cleaning

-  I found that Tableau Prep Builder has more available options for cleaning data than Tableau Desktop. Hence, I switched to Tableau Prep Builder for cleaning phase. The cleaning phase in Tableau Prep Builder was very simple and straightforward.
-  Another benefit of using Tableau Prep Builder was that it provided recommendations for cleaning data.

- A scatter plot shows that there is no relationship between quality of education and world rank of universities. However, universities with higher rankings tend to have higher ranking of citations as well.
- A horizontal bar graph is used to show the top 20 countries with the most top ranked universities. Accordingly, USA has the most top ranked universities, followed by China, Japan and United Kingdom. 
- The visual world map and bar graph also clearly display that there are mostly top universities in USA, Asia and Europe countries.

## 5. Personal User Experience
### Opportunity 
- There are tutorials for beginners on Tableau Desktop
- Comparatively easier to learn than other visualisation tools (Personal opinion)
- Ease of implementation and the process is very simple and straightforward.
- There are various types of visualisations available.
- There are recommendation tools for data cleaning and visualisations.
- Especially useful when analysing a large dataset.

### Challenges
- A lack of data cleaning options in Tableau Desktop
- Need to use two different tools, Tableau Prep Builder for data cleaning and visualisations for Tableau Desktop
- I found Tableau a bit difficult to create desired format and design of visualisations.
